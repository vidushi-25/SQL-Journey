SELECT * from myntra.products WHERE

Alternative to above :

SELECT * from myntra.products WHERE

product_tag = 'shoes' and
discounted_price betweeb 5000 and 7000;

**-- To select unique values from a column :**

SELECT distinct(product_tag) from myntra.products;

**-- To count the unique values from a column :**

SELECT COUNT(distinct(product_tag)) from myntra.products;
